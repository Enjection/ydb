# Comprehensive Plan for Fixing YDB Incremental Restore

## Current Status Summary (Updated: July 2, 2025)

### ‚úÖ **Completed Successfully**
1. **Phase 1-5**: Schema transactions are being sent and accepted correctly
2. **Sequence Number Issue**: Fixed - DataShard accepts transactions with correct seqNo
3. **SchemeShard Logic**: Properly sends `TEvRunIncrementalRestore` and schema transactions
4. **Debug Logging**: Added comprehensive logging to key components

### üîç **Critical Discovery Made**
**ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED**: `TCreateIncrementalRestoreSrcUnit::Run()` is **NEVER** being called despite:
- ‚úÖ Schema transaction being accepted: "Prepared scheme transaction"
- ‚úÖ Correct sequence numbers (seqNo 2:5)
- ‚úÖ No compilation or registration errors

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Primary Issues Found**

#### **Issue #1: Schema Transaction Path Mapping Bug** ‚úÖ (FIXED)
**Location**: `schemeshard_incremental_restore_scan.cpp:169-170`
```cpp
// INCORRECT (OLD): Both paths were set to the same tablePathId
restoreBackup.MutableSrcPathId()->CopyFrom(tablePathId.ToProto());
restoreBackup.MutableDstPathId()->CopyFrom(tablePathId.ToProto());
```

**FIXED**: Applied correct path mapping logic:
- `SrcPathId` = Backup table path (where incremental backup data is stored)
- `DstPathId` = Destination table path (where changes should be applied)

#### **Issue #2: Backup Table Lookup Failure** ‚úÖ (FIXED)
**Location**: Same file, backup table discovery logic
**Problem**: The backup table discovery logic was looking for backup tables as direct children of backup collection with same name, but backup tables are actually stored within timestamped backup entries.
**Solution**: Updated logic to:
1. Find incremental backup entries (those containing "_incremental") within backup collection
2. Look for backup tables within these timestamped backup entries
3. Match table names within backup entries to destination table names

#### **Issue #3: Execution Unit Not Triggered** ‚ö†Ô∏è (CURRENT ISSUE)
**Location**: DataShard execution unit pipeline
**Problem**: 
- Schema transactions are sent and accepted successfully
- `TCreateIncrementalRestoreSrcUnit::Run()` is never called
- No debug logs appear from execution unit despite proper registration
- Data remains completely unchanged after restore operation

### üîß **Next Actions**
1. ‚úÖ **Fix Path Mapping**: Completed - Corrected source/destination paths in schema transaction
2. ‚úÖ **Fix Backup Table Lookup**: Completed - Updated backup table discovery to look within timestamped backup entries
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Fix Execution Unit Triggering**: Current focus - Debug why execution unit is not being called
4. üîç **Test Complete Fix**: Verify that all fixes resolve the incremental restore issue

### üìä **Test Status**
- **Expected**: `(2,2000), (3,30), (4,40)` (after incremental restore)
- **Actual**: `(1,10), (2,20), (3,30), (4,40), (5,50)` (no changes applied)
- **Issue**: Data remains completely unchanged

## üéØ **Debug Progress Summary**

### ‚úÖ **Confirmed Working Components**
1. **Schema Transaction Pipeline**: 
   - Schema transactions are being sent and accepted successfully 
   - No errors in schema transaction processing

2. **Path Mapping Fix Applied**:
   - Fixed the bug where both `SrcPathId` and `DstPathId` were set to same `tablePathId`
   - Applied correct mapping logic to set source as backup table and destination as target table

3. **Backup Table Discovery Fix Applied**:
   - Fixed backup table lookup to find tables within timestamped incremental backup entries
   - Successfully finds backup tables: `backupTablePathId# [LocalPathId: 12]` and `[LocalPathId: 14]`
   - Schema transactions now being sent with `requestCount# 1`

4. **Execution Unit Infrastructure**:
   - `TCreateIncrementalRestoreSrcUnit` class exists and is properly registered
   - Has debug logging that would show when it executes
   - Ready to process restore requests when they are correctly generated
   - **Confirmed**: Execution unit is included in schema transaction execution plan (line 865 in `datashard_active_transaction.cpp`)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Current Investigation Focus**
**DataShard Execution Pipeline Analysis**: The investigation has narrowed down to understanding why the DataShard execution pipeline stops progressing after the "Prepared scheme transaction" phase. Key findings:

1. ‚úÖ **Schema Transaction Preparation**: Working correctly - transactions are accepted and prepared
2. ‚úÖ **Execution Plan Building**: `CreateIncrementalRestoreSrc` execution unit is properly included in the plan  
3. ‚ùå **Pipeline Progression**: The execution pipeline does not advance from preparation to execution unit execution
4. üîç **Root Cause**: Need to identify what blocks the pipeline from progressing to execution units

This represents significant progress - the issue has been isolated from "execution unit not working" to "execution pipeline not progressing", which is a more specific and solvable problem.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Current Blocking Issue**
**Execution Pipeline Stuck After Preparation**: Despite schema transactions being sent and accepted successfully with correct path mapping, the DataShard execution pipeline stops progressing after the "Prepared scheme transaction" phase. The `TCreateIncrementalRestoreSrcUnit::Run()` execution unit is never called, indicating the execution pipeline is not advancing to the execution unit phase.

### üîç **Investigation Completed**
- ‚úÖ Log analysis confirmed schema transactions work
- ‚úÖ Code analysis found path mapping bug
- ‚úÖ Protobuf structure analysis confirmed correct schema
- ‚úÖ Applied path mapping fix
- ‚úÖ Discovered and fixed backup table lookup issue
- ‚úÖ Confirmed schema transactions are now sent with correct paths and `requestCount# 1`
- ‚úÖ Latest test logs show backup tables are found correctly within incremental backup entries
- ‚úÖ **Execution Plan Analysis**: Confirmed `EExecutionUnitKind::CreateIncrementalRestoreSrc` is included in schema transaction execution plan (line 865 in `datashard_active_transaction.cpp`)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Current blocker**: DataShard execution pipeline stops after "Prepared scheme transaction" and never progresses to execution unit execution phase

## Plan Overview

### Phase 1: Clean Up Incorrect Implementation ‚úÖ (COMPLETED)
1. ‚úÖ Remove the incorrect files created earlier:
   - `datashard__restore_multiple_incremental_backups.cpp`
   - `datashard_incremental_restore.cpp`
2. ‚úÖ Remove references from `ya.make`
3. ‚úÖ Remove the `TTxIncrementalRestore` declaration from `datashard_impl.h`
4. ‚úÖ Remove the `TEvRestoreMultipleIncrementalBackups` handler from `datashard.cpp`
5. ‚úÖ Remove event definitions from `datashard.h`
6. ‚úÖ Remove handler from `schemeshard_impl.cpp`

### Phase 2: Update Schemeshard to Send Proper Schema Transactions ‚úÖ (ALREADY COMPLETED)
1. ‚úÖ **Modify `schemeshard_incremental_restore_scan.cpp`**:
   - ‚úÖ Replace direct `TEvRestoreMultipleIncrementalBackups` events with schema transactions
   - ‚úÖ Use `TEvProposeTransaction` with `CreateIncrementalRestoreSrc` schema operations
   - ‚úÖ Set up proper `TRestoreIncrementalBackup` protobuf messages

2. ‚úÖ **Schema Transaction Structure**: Already implemented correctly
   ```protobuf
   TEvProposeTransaction {
     TxId: <txId>
     PathId: <destination table path>
     SchemeTx {
       CreateIncrementalRestoreSrc {
         SrcPathId: <backup table path>
         DstPathId: <destination table path>
       }
     }
   }
   ```

### Phase 3: Handle Multiple Incremental Backups ‚úÖ (ALREADY COMPLETED)
1. ‚úÖ **Sequential Processing**: Each schema transaction handles one backup table, multiple transactions sent for multiple incremental backups
2. ‚úÖ **Coordination**: Operation tracking waits for all backup table restorations to complete
3. ‚úÖ **Response Handling**: Processes `TEvProposeTransactionResult` responses from all datashard transactions

### Phase 4: Verify Integration ‚úÖ (COMPLETED)
1. ‚úÖ **Test Execution**: Test runs and incremental restore is triggered correctly
2. ‚úÖ **Schema Transaction Issue**: DataShard now accepts transactions with correct sequence numbers (seqNo 2:5)
3. ‚ùå **Data Validation**: Data remains unchanged despite successful schema transaction:
   - Original: (1,10), (2,20), (3,30), (4,40), (5,50)
   - Expected after restore: (2,2000), (3,30), (4,40)
   - **Actual**: (1,10), (2,20), (3,30), (4,40), (5,50) ‚Üê No changes applied

### Phase 5: Fix Sequence Number Issue ‚úÖ (COMPLETED)
1. ‚úÖ **Problem Fixed**: Schema transactions now use correct sequence numbers
2. ‚úÖ **Transaction Acceptance**: DataShard accepts and processes transactions successfully
3. ‚úÖ **Status**: "Prepared scheme transaction" instead of "Ignore message"

### Phase 6: Debug Incremental Restore Execution üîç (CRITICAL DISCOVERY MADE)

#### Step 6.1: Analyze Current Status ‚úÖ (COMPLETED)
**SYMPTOMS**:
- ‚úÖ SchemeShard sends `TEvRunIncrementalRestore` correctly
- ‚úÖ Schema transactions are created and accepted by DataShard
- ‚ùå **CRITICAL DISCOVERY**: `TCreateIncrementalRestoreSrcUnit::Run()` is NEVER called
- ‚ùå **Data modifications are NOT applied to destination table**

**ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS** ‚úÖ (IDENTIFIED):
1. ‚úÖ Schema transaction is accepted: "Prepared scheme transaction txId 281474976715666"
2. ‚ùå **`TCreateIncrementalRestoreSrcUnit::Run()` never executes** (no debug logs appear)
3. ‚ùå This means the execution unit is not being triggered despite transaction acceptance

#### Step 6.2: Investigation Points ‚úÖ (PARTIALLY COMPLETED)
1. ‚úÖ **Verify Execution Unit Triggering**: CONFIRMED - Execution unit is NOT being called
2. üîç **Check IsRelevant() method**: Added debug logging to verify if execution unit filter is working
3. üîç **Examine Schema Transaction Content**: Need to verify SrcPathId/DstPathId are correct
4. üîç **Check Execution Unit Registration**: Ensure execution unit is properly registered

#### Step 6.3: Debugging Strategy
1. **Add Debug Logging**: Insert logging in key components to trace execution
2. **Examine Test Data Setup**: Verify incremental backup contains expected changes
3. **Check Path Resolution**: Ensure source/destination paths are correctly mapped
4. **Validate Scan Creation**: Confirm incremental restore scan is created and running

### Phase 7: Fix DataShard Execution Pipeline Issue üõ†Ô∏è (CURRENT FOCUS)

#### Step 7.1: Root Cause Analysis ‚úÖ (REFINED)
**PROBLEM**: DataShard execution pipeline stops progressing after schema transaction preparation phase.

**INVESTIGATION FINDINGS**:
1. ‚úÖ **Execution Unit Registration**: `TCreateIncrementalRestoreSrcUnit` is properly registered and included in execution plan
2. ‚úÖ **Execution Plan Building**: `EExecutionUnitKind::CreateIncrementalRestoreSrc` is included in schema transaction execution plan (confirmed at line 865 in `datashard_active_transaction.cpp`)
3. ‚úÖ **Schema Transaction Acceptance**: Transactions are accepted with "Prepared scheme transaction" logs
4. ‚ùå **Pipeline Progression**: Execution pipeline stops after preparation and never reaches execution unit execution phase

**BREAKTHROUGH DISCOVERY - FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED**: 
The root cause is that the current implementation bypasses SchemeShard's proper transaction execution flow. Using `MakeDataShardProposal()` + direct event sending bypasses SchemeShard's transaction management system, which means:
- Schema transactions are sent directly to DataShards without proper SchemeShard transaction lifecycle
- DataShards receive and accept the schema transactions but they lack the proper plan steps needed for execution pipeline progression
- The execution units are never triggered because the transactions don't go through SchemeShard's complete transaction execution mechanism
- This explains why "Prepared scheme transaction" is logged but execution units never run

**REFINED ROOT CAUSE**: The issue is not with DataShard execution pipeline, but with bypassing SchemeShard's transaction execution flow that would normally provide the proper plan steps and coordination needed for execution units to be triggered.

#### Step 7.2: Investigation Steps ‚úÖ (COMPLETED)
1. ‚úÖ **Added Debug Logging**: Added logging to `TCreateIncrementalRestoreSrcUnit::Run()` and `IsRelevant()`
2. ‚úÖ **Verified Execution Unit Registration**: Confirmed execution unit is properly registered and included in execution plan
3. ‚úÖ **Confirmed Schema Transaction Content**: Verified `CreateIncrementalRestoreSrc` is properly set with correct path mapping
4. ‚úÖ **Execution Plan Analysis**: Confirmed `EExecutionUnitKind::CreateIncrementalRestoreSrc` is included in schema transaction execution plan at line 865
5. ‚úÖ **BREAKTHROUGH**: Identified that the fundamental issue is bypassing SchemeShard transaction execution flow

#### Step 7.3: DataShard Pipeline Investigation ‚úÖ (BREAKTHROUGH COMPLETED)
**ROOT CAUSE DISCOVERED**: The current implementation uses `MakeDataShardProposal()` + event sending which bypasses SchemeShard's transaction management system.

**ANALYSIS**:
- Schema transactions require proper SchemeShard transaction execution flow to get the necessary plan steps
- Direct event sending to DataShards bypasses this critical infrastructure
- DataShards accept the transactions but without proper plan steps, execution units are never triggered
- The "Prepared scheme transaction" log confirms acceptance but pipeline stops there due to missing coordination

**SOLUTION IDENTIFIED**: Replace event-based approach with direct schema transaction execution within SchemeShard's transaction flow.

#### Step 7.4: Implementation Plan üîß (NEW APPROACH)
1. ‚úÖ **Fix Source/Destination Path Mapping**: Completed - Corrected the path assignment in schema transaction
2. ‚úÖ **Fix Backup Table Discovery**: Completed - Updated backup table lookup logic 
3. üîß **Implement Direct Schema Transaction Execution**: Replace `MakeDataShardProposal()` + event sending with direct schema transaction execution within `TTxProgress::Execute()`
4. üîß **Remove Event-Based Infrastructure**: Clean up the event handling that bypasses SchemeShard transaction flow
5. üîß **Integrate with SchemeShard Transaction Flow**: Use proper SchemeShard transaction execution mechanism to ensure transactions get proper plan steps
6. üîç **Test Complete Fix**: Verify that all fixes resolve the incremental restore issue

### Phase 8: Implement Direct Schema Transaction Execution üîß (CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION)

#### Step 8.1: Replace Event-Based Approach with Direct Execution ‚ö†Ô∏è (IN PROGRESS)
**GOAL**: Execute schema transactions directly within SchemeShard's transaction flow instead of bypassing it with events.

**IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY**:
1. **Remove Event Infrastructure**: Remove `MakeDataShardProposal()` usage and event handling
2. **Direct Transaction Execution**: Execute schema transactions directly within `TTxProgress::Execute()` using SchemeShard's transaction execution mechanism
3. **Proper Plan Steps**: Ensure transactions get the proper plan steps needed for DataShard execution pipeline progression
4. **Transaction Coordination**: Use SchemeShard's built-in transaction coordination instead of custom event handling

#### Step 8.2: Technical Implementation Details üõ†Ô∏è (NEXT)
**KEY CHANGES NEEDED**:
1. **In `TTxProgress::Execute()`**: Replace event sending with direct schema transaction execution
2. **Transaction Management**: Use SchemeShard's transaction infrastructure for proper lifecycle management
3. **Plan Step Generation**: Ensure schema transactions generate proper plan steps for DataShard execution
4. **Response Handling**: Update response processing to work with SchemeShard transaction results

**EXPECTED OUTCOME**: 
- Schema transactions will be executed through proper SchemeShard transaction flow
- DataShards will receive transactions with proper plan steps
- Execution units will be triggered correctly
- Incremental restore will apply data changes successfully
